# Hadoop-Questions-and-Answers

This repository holds my answers to hadoop related questions from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zJt9qAe01w . I used it as a good way to structurize and extend my practical knowledge and commercial experience on working with Hadoop clusters. 

In all files I have denoted my answer with MA and an answer suggested in the video as VA.
